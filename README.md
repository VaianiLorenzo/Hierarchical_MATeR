# Hierarchical MATeR

This repository contains qualitative examples and specific details for our paper _HiMATeR: Leveraging Sentence-Level Relations for Multimodal Audio Podcast Summarization_.

In this work, we present a new multimodal transformer-based approach to summarize audio podcast episodes. The innovative contributions of the proposal are threefold:
- The combined use of acoustic and textual features thanks to the adoption of an audio-text fusion stage.
- The adoption of a hierarchical Transformer to handle long transcripts and capture sentence-level text relations.
- The integration of Large Language Models in an extract-and-then-abstract pipeline for audio podcast summarization.

This work extends a previously published paper, titled _[Leveraging multimodal content for podcast summarization](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3477314.3507106)_ presented at ACM SAC 2022.

More details about code usability will be provided upon acceptance.
