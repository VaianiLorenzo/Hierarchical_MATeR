# Hierarchical MATeR

This repository contains qualitative examples and specific details for our paper _HiMATeR: Leveraging Sentence-Level Relations for Multimodal Audio Podcast Summarization_.

In this work, we present a new multimodal transformer-based approach to summarize audio podcast episodes. The innovative contributions of the proposal are threefold:
A) The combined use of acoustic and textual features thanks to the adoption of an audio-text fusion stage.
B) The adoption of a hierarchical Transformer to handle long transcripts and capture sentence-level text relations.
C) The integration of Large Language Models in an extract-and-then-abstract pipeline for audio podcast summarization.

This work extends a previously published paper, titled _Leveraging multimodal content for podcast summarization_ presented at ACM SAC 2022.

More details about code usability will be provided upon acceptance.
